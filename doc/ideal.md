Geometry deals with general concepts. Consider the following property for example: "all isoscles triangles have 2 congruent angles". In order to prove this statement we draw one of the infinitely many possible diagrams. Which seems in itself that it is "proof by giving an example" fallacy.

But in fact, what we do is that we project some of these infinitely many diagrams into an instance that we can generalize the proof for the rest of the diagrams. That's why it is important to pick a triangle that does not give you any information or relation that is not necessarily available in the rest of the diagrams, and at the same time give you a clear picture of what is going on. Hence, the following problem is proposed:

### The most scalene triangle problem

$$
\text{Given a unit circle, what is the 'most scalene' triangle possible?}
$$

Here we didn't define precisely $\text{'most scalene'}$ but we'll figure out the best definition by giving us the best visual result.

* Values of $a, b, c$ are as scattered as possible
* Distances between $H, G, O$ are as big as possible
